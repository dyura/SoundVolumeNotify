Most non-smart cell phones display an indicator on the screen that shows the ringer volume level. In Android, there is no visual indication of the volume level. We will have to go through several steps to check how loud the phone sounds.
The Sound Volume Notifier constantly informs the phone owner about the current volume level of ring, alarm and media. The application starts automatically when the phone boots and shows a persistent notification in the status bar. A notification icon is generated dynamically and displays the levels of the ring and the alarm. The icon also indicates when the media volume is low. If the volume is less than 4, the separator between the two numbers is changed from a colon to an underscore. In the notification drawer you can see the exact value of the media volume along with the ring and alarm volumes.
The application checks volumes every minute and accordingly updates the notification.
Additionally, the main screen has an option to change the ring volume. This option was added because, starting with Android 8, Google decided to make hard volume buttons only to control volume of multimedia. Thus, the standard way to change the ringer volume is time consuming.
